# Code Repository for My Blog

Welcome to the code repository for my [ðŸ“– personal blog](https://vladislav-morozov.github.io/blog/)!

This repository contains the code for all the blog posts with code. Each post own folder with a README that provides an overview and any replication/usage instructions.

 

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Structure

The structure of the repository reflects the categories on the blog. Current folder structure:
```
â”œâ”€â”€ Simulations
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Tools                      # Tools for simulations
|       â”œâ”€â”€ ...
â”œâ”€â”€ Statistics
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Heterogeneity              # Dealing with unseen heterogeneity in data
|       â”œâ”€â”€ ...
```

## Getting Started

To get started with any of the code in this repository, navigate to the relevant post folder and follow the instructions in the README file. Each README contains an overview of the post, the purpose of the code, and step-by-step instructions to replicate the results.
