# The Hidden Delta Method in statsmodels (A Worked Example)

This folder contains Python codes with a worked example of using the delta method in `statsmodels`.

## Overview, Blog Post, and a Visual Summary

The delta method is a core tool in applied causal inference.

It is implemented in `statsmodels`, however the functionality was not documented. Accordingly, I decided to write a quick tutorial post.

This post walks through a worked example using that hidden functionality. It focuses on how to apply the delta method in practice with `statsmodels`: estimating nonlinear transformations, computing standard errors, building confidence intervals, and running Wald tests in a real setting.

The example in the post estimates the relationship between wages and experience. The nonlinear parameter of interest is how many years you have to work to maximize your yearly earnings.
